Vocabulary
	* for every train image
		+ compute keypoints features
		+ extract keypoints descriptors
			+ add keypoints descriptors to BOWKMeansTrainer		

	+ vocabulary = cluster() points in BOWKMeansTrainer
	+ setVocabulary in BOWImgDescriptorExtractor

Samples
	+ compute car samples
		+ use compute(img, keyPoints, imgDescriptors) in BOWImgDescriptorExtractor
		+ compute keypoints labels (car / non-car)
			+ use red masks to detect if keypoint is car or not

Train classifier
	+ train classifier
		+ train_auto -> use imgDescriptors and labels

Test classifier
	* for every test image
		+ compute keypoints features
		+ extract keypoints descriptors with BOWImgDescriptorExtractor
		+ use classifier to predict if car is in image

	+ Precision-Recall
		+ Precision -> true positives / detected cars
		+ Recall -> true positives / total number of cars in image
